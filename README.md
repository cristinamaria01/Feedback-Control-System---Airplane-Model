# Feedback-Control-System---Airplane-Model
This project is about the transfer from the angle of brazing of the engine on the left wing of a civil aircraft at the ascent speed a it. The airplane model was deduced analytically, by writing the system of nonlinear differential equations of a solid-rigid body in atmospheric flight.
